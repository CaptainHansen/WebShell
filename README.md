WebShell
========

Designing a website?  No shell access?  No problem!

Installing is more than easy!

1. Copy the entire wshell folder to a place accessible via a web browser.
2. Navigate in your web browser to the wshell folder you just copied.
3. Start running commands!
	
NOTE: In order to get the output of stderr, redirect it to stdout by adding " 2> /dev/stdout" at the end of the command you want to execute.
